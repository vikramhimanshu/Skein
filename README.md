Rearrange the randomly ordered cards to make 4 sets of royal flush to complete the game. Don’t know what royal flush means or playing cards are just not your thing? No problem, imagine this as arranging these cards in a descending order (Ace to 10) from left to right.  You can complete the game as long as you stick to these rules:  1. Only empty spots can be used to place cards - no exchanges 2. Left column can only be occupied by the Ace’s (A) 3. To place a card, the left spot should not be empty 4. A card can only be moved if the card being moved is of the same suit and a rank lower than the card to the left at the destination position  Perfect way to engage your brains when you are waiting for a bus or cab, sitting home all by yourself, feeling geeky or even if just bored.  Good source of entertainment and yeah, just because you competed it, don’t think you mastered it ;)
